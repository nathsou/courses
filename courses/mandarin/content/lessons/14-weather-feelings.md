title: Weather and feelings
goals:
  - describe things and people with adjectives, and know why 很 is there
  - talk about the weather and how you feel
  - ask "how is it?" with 怎么样, and react with 真, 非常 and 有点儿
---

Small talk runs on adjectives: it's cold, I'm tired, the film was great, the food is too spicy. Chinese adjectives behave differently from English ones in one important way, and once you get it, a whole class of mistakes disappears.

## Adjectives are verbs

In Chinese, adjectives work like verbs: they don't need 是. "The tea is hot" is 茶很热, literally "tea very hot".

So why the 很 (very)? A bare adjective sounds like a **comparison**: 茶热 suggests "the tea is hot (but the coffee isn't)". 很 makes it a neutral statement. In 我很好 or 天气很冷, 很 doesn't really mean "very", it's just the glue.

| Chinese | Means |
| --- | --- |
| 我很忙。 | I'm busy. |
| 今天很冷。 | It's cold today. |
| 他不高兴。 | He's not happy. (不 replaces 很) |
| 这个菜非常好吃！ | This dish is really delicious! |
| 你累吗？ | Are you tired? |

```words
很 | very; (links an adjective)
非常 | extremely, very
真 | really, truly
太 | too (much)
高兴 | happy
忙 | busy
累 | tired
热 | hot
冷 | cold
```

:::mistake
我是很高兴 ✗ · 我很高兴 ✓. Adjectives never take 是. If you hear yourself starting "我是…" before an adjective, stop and drop the 是.

```order
title: Adjective sentences
items:
  - en: I'm very busy today.
    zh: 我 今天 很 忙
    extra: [是]
  - en: The weather is really nice.
    zh: 天气 真 好
  - en: This tea is too hot!
    zh: 这 杯 茶 太 热 了
  - en: He isn't happy.
    zh: 他 不 高兴
    extra: [是]
```

## The weather

```words
天气 | weather
下雨 | to rain
雨 | rain
雪 | snow
晴 | sunny, clear
阴 | cloudy, overcast
```

Rain and snow "fall down": 下雨 (it's raining), 下雪 (it's snowing). To say "it's starting to rain" or "it's raining now", add 了 at the end, which marks a **change**: 下雨了！ It's raining (now)!

```dialogue
title: Weather talk
小红: 今天天气怎么样？ | What's the weather like today?
马克: 不太好，很冷。 | Not great, it's cold.
小红: 明天呢？ | And tomorrow?
马克: 明天下雨。 | It's going to rain tomorrow.
小红: 啊，下雨了！ | Oh, it's started raining!
马克: 真的！太冷了，我们回家吧。 | It has! It's too cold, let's go home.
```

## How is it? 怎么样

怎么样 (zěnmeyàng) asks "how is it?" about almost anything, and it goes at the end, where the answer goes:

- 天气怎么样？ How's the weather?
- 这个电影怎么样？ How was the film?
- 你身体怎么样？ How's your health?
- 我们明天去，怎么样？ Let's go tomorrow, how about it?

And 怎么 alone asks "how (to do)" or "how come": 这个字怎么读？ How do you read this character?

```words
怎么样 | how is it? how about…?
怎么 | how; how come
好听 | nice-sounding
好看 | good-looking
```

## Feeling unwell

```words
病 | illness; ill
生病 | to fall ill
看病 | to see a doctor
医生 | doctor
休息 | to rest
有点儿 | a bit (usually something unwelcome)
```

有点儿 + adjective means "a bit…", usually for things you'd rather not be: 我有点儿累 (I'm a bit tired), 今天有点儿冷 (it's a bit cold). Lesson 22 will show how it differs from 一点儿, which comes after the adjective.

:::culture
Weather small talk is as common in China as in Britain, and so is talk about health: friends will cheerfully tell you to drink hot water (多喝热水) for almost any ailment, from a cold to a broken heart. It has become a running joke online.
:::

:::key
- Adjectives work like verbs: no 是. 很 is the default glue: 我很忙.
- 下雨 / 下雪 for rain and snow; 下雨了 = it's started raining.
- 怎么样 at the end asks "how is it?" or "how about it?".
- 有点儿 + adjective = a bit (usually unwelcome).
