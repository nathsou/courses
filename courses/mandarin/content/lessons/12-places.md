title: Where is it?
goals:
  - say where things and people are with 在 and position words
  - talk about going, coming and returning, and how you travel
  - ask for and understand simple directions
---

Asking where something is may be the most useful question in any language: the toilet, the station, your hotel. In Chinese it is also a lesson in the language's logic. Chinese describes location like a camera: first the reference point, then the zoom. "Next to the bank" becomes "the bank's side".

## Being somewhere: 在

在 (zài) means "to be at / in". Unlike 是, it is about location:

| Chinese | Means |
| --- | --- |
| 我在家。 | I'm at home. |
| 妈妈在医院。 | Mum is at the hospital. |
| 你在哪儿？ | Where are you? |
| 他不在学校。 | He's not at school. |

To ask where, put 哪儿 (nǎr, where) in the place of the answer, as always: 洗手间在哪儿？ "Where's the toilet?"

```words
在 | to be at, in
哪儿 | where
这儿 | here
那儿 | there
哪里 | where (more southern / formal)
这里 | here
那里 | there
家 | home
学校 | school
医院 | hospital
公司 | company, office
房间 | room
```

:::note
哪儿/这儿/那儿, with the *-r* sound, are typical of Beijing and the north; 哪里/这里/那里 are used more in the south and in writing. Both are standard and everyone understands both.
:::

## Position words

To say "next to the bank" or "in the room", Chinese puts the reference first, then a position word: X的左边 is "X's left side".

| Position | Chinese | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inside | 里 / 里面 | 房间里 in the room |
| outside | 外 / 外边 | 学校外边 outside the school |
| on, above | 上 / 上面 | 桌子上 on the table |
| under, below | 下 / 下面 | 椅子下面 under the chair |
| in front | 前面 | 医院前面 in front of the hospital |
| behind | 后面 | 学校后面 behind the school |
| left | 左边 | 银行的左边 left of the bank |
| right | 右边 | 我的右边 on my right |
| next to | 旁边 | 书店旁边 next to the bookshop |

The full sentence is **thing + 在 + place + position**: 猫在桌子下面。 The cat is under the table.

```words
里 | in, inside
外 | outside
外边 | outside
上 | on, above
下 | under, below
边 | side
这边 | this side, over here
那边 | that side, over there
前 | front
后 | behind, back
```

```order
title: Where is it?
items:
  - en: The cat is under the table.
    zh: 猫 在 桌子 下面
  - en: Where is the hospital?
    zh: 医院 在 哪儿
  - en: My phone is in the room.
    zh: 我 的 手机 在 房间 里
  - en: The bookshop is next to the school.
    zh: 书店 在 学校 旁边
    extra: [是]
```

## Going, coming, getting there

```words
去 | to go
来 | to come
到 | to arrive; to
回 | to return (home)
住 | to live, to stay
坐 | to sit; to take (transport)
开车 | to drive
车 | car, vehicle
出租车 | taxi
飞机 | plane
火车 | train
```

Movement is simple: verb + place, no preposition needed. 我去学校 (I go school), 你来我家 (you come my home), 我们回家 (we return home).

How you travel goes **before** the verb, with 坐 (sit) for anything you ride in, and 开 for driving:

- 我**坐飞机**去北京。 I'm flying to Beijing (sitting-plane go Beijing).
- 他**坐出租车**回家。 He takes a taxi home.
- 妈妈**开车**去公司。 Mum drives to work.

This is the same idea as with time: the *how* and *when* come before the *what*. You'll see it again and again.

    en: I'm going to Beijing tomorrow.
