Your Chinese can now get you through a day. This lesson is about filling the weekend: inviting friends, talking about what you enjoy, and saying no without offending anyone (which in China is an art in itself).

## Let's do it together

一起 (yìqǐ, together) goes before the verb, and 吧 turns a statement into a suggestion:

- 我们一起去吧！ Let's go together!
- 明天一起吃饭，怎么样？ Dinner together tomorrow, how about it?
- 你想跟我一起看电影吗？ Would you like to see a film with me?

跟 + person + 一起 = with someone.

```words
一起 | together
跟 | with
吧 | let’s…
为什么 | why
有意思 | interesting, fun
没意思 | boring
```

## Hobbies and sports

```words
爱好 | hobby
运动 | sport; to exercise
足球 | football
篮球 | basketball
球 | ball
踢 | to kick, to play (football)
打 | to play (ball games with hands)
游泳 | to swim
游 | to swim
跑步 | to go running
跳舞 | to dance
画 | to draw, to paint
笑 | to laugh, to smile
动 | to move
花 | flower; to spend
鱼 | fish
鸟 | bird
```

Ball games take different verbs depending on how you play them: 踢足球 (kick football), 打篮球 (hit basketball), 打乒乓球 (hit table tennis). It's a nice example of Chinese being concrete where English is generic.

```sort
title: 踢 or 打?
prompt: Which verb goes with each game?
buckets: [踢, 打]
items:
  - [足球, 0]
  - [篮球, 1]
  - [乒乓球, 1]
  - [网球, 1]
explain: You kick a football (踢) and hit the rest (打).
```

## Why? 为什么

为什么 (wèishénme, "for what") asks why, and goes before the verb. The answer usually starts with 因为:

> 你为什么不去？ Why aren't you going? — 因为我很忙。 Because I'm busy.

## Celebrations

```words
生日 | birthday
快乐 | happy
过年 | to celebrate New Year
送 | to give (as a gift)
```

生日快乐！ Happy birthday! 新年快乐！ Happy New Year!

:::culture
The biggest festival is the Spring Festival (春节), Chinese New Year, in January or February. People travel home in the world's largest annual migration, eat dumplings at midnight, give children red envelopes of money (红包), and set off fireworks. 过年 means "to pass the year", celebrating it. Gifts have etiquette too: never give a clock (送钟 sounds like attending a funeral) and don't wrap presents in white.

## Saying yes, saying no

Accepting is easy: 好啊！, 好的, 没问题 (no problem). Saying no directly can sound blunt, so people soften it with a reason, an apology and a counter-offer:

> 不好意思，明天我有事，下次吧！ Sorry, I've got something on tomorrow; next time!

下次吧 (next time) is the polite, vague no, a bit like "let's take a rain check".
