"What are you doing?" is one of the most common questions in any messaging app. Chinese has a neat set of small words for actions in progress, states that last, and things just about to happen, and they all slot into sentences you already know.

## In progress: 在 and 正在

You've met 在 as "to be at". Before a verb, it means the action is **in progress**:

- 我**在**吃饭。 I'm eating.
- 他**正在**上课。 He's in class right now. (正在 = right in the middle of)
- 你在做什么呢？ What are you up to? (呢 at the end adds a friendly, ongoing feel)

The negative is 没(在): 我没在看电视 (I'm not watching TV).

```words
在 | (before a verb) to be doing
正在 | right in the middle of doing
正 | just, right (now)
等 | to wait
一会儿 | a moment, a while
```

```dialogue
title: What are you doing?
小红: 喂，你在做什么呢？ | Hey, what are you up to?
马克: 我正在做饭。你呢？ | I'm cooking. You?
小红: 我在等公交车。 | I'm waiting for the bus.
马克: 你等了多长时间？ | How long have you been waiting?
小红: 二十分钟了！啊，车来了！一会儿给你打电话！ | Twenty minutes! Oh, the bus is here! I'll call you in a bit!
```

## States that last: 着

着 (zhe) after a verb describes a **state** that continues, often the result of an action: the door has been opened and is now open.

- 门开**着**。 The door is open.
- 她穿**着**一件红衣服。 She's wearing a red top.
- 他坐**着**看书。 He's reading, sitting down. (sitting-ly reads)

The difference from 在: 在 is an action going on (他在穿衣服, he's getting dressed); 着 is the state it leaves (他穿着衣服, he's dressed).

```words
着 | (after a verb) ongoing state
拿 | to hold, to take
洗 | to wash
床 | bed
手表 | wristwatch
```

  - prompt: "\"He's holding a cup\""
    options: [他拿着一个杯子。, 他在拿一个杯子了。]
    answer: 0
```

## About to happen: 快要…了

快要…了, 快…了 and 要…了 all mean something is **about to** happen. The 了 at the end is the "change" 了: a new situation is arriving.

- 火车**快要**开**了**！ The train is about to leave!
- **快**八点**了**。 It's nearly eight.
- 我**要**回家**了**。 I'm about to go home.

```words
快要 | about to, nearly
快 | soon; fast
准备 | to get ready; to plan to
```
